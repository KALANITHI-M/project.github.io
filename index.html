            <h3>BATTLE ROYAL</h3>
        The Battle Royale mode in Free Fire accommodates up to 52 players landing on an island without weapons. 
        They must fight to be the last one standing by scavenging weapons and equipment from buildings. 
        Playing this mode in ranked mode will affect their ranking. 
        There are 6 maps to choose from: Bermuda, Bermuda Remastered, Kalahari, Purgatory, Alpine, and NeXTerra. 
        The mode allows for solo, duo, or squad play.
            
            <h3>CLASH SQUAD</h3>
            Clash Squad is a 4-player versus 4-player mode where players purchase weapons and items from an in-game shop during preparation time, then engage in combat against the opposing team.
            The mode is played in a best-of-7 format, lasting anywhere from 4 to 7 rounds. 
            Each round is won when all players from one team are killed, either by their opponents or through environmental factors. 
            The mode can be played as either Ranked or Casual.
            
            <h3>LONE WOLF</h3>
            Lone Wolf is a variation of the Clash Squad mode that can be played as either a 1-player versus 1-player or 2-player versus 2-player "duo" format with more intricate rules.
            In each round, both sides have the opportunity to select their equipment for the next 2 rounds. The game is played in a best-of-5 format. 
            If both teams have won 4 rounds each, a final round begins with both sides able to choose any weapon they prefer. 
            All players are automatically equipped with basic items such as a vest and helmet from the start of the round. 
            This mode takes place on its own map known as Iron Dome.
            
            <h3>CRAFTLAND</h3>
            Free Fire Craftland editor
            Free Fire Craftland Editor

            Craftland allows players to design their own maps in Free Fire using an in-game builder tool. 
            The maps created can be shared and played with others.
            Craftland also supports script editing for advanced customization, giving creators greater freedom to bring their ideas to life.
            Players can add buildings, gameplay elements, and decorations to the map until they reach the maximum space limit. 
            There are two maps available for players to use as the base for their designs.</pre>
